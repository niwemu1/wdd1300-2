            <h3>Akagera National Park</h3>
            
            <img src="https://africageographic.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Gallery-6.jpg" >
            <P>Akagera National Park, Rwanda, is almost unrecognisable today compared to over 20 years ago when it was on the verge of being irreparably degraded. The aftermath of the 1994 genocide against the Tutsi had a devastating impact on the environment, making its story of revival even more remarkable. In 2010, African Parks partnered with the Rwanda Development Board (RDB) to assume management of Akagera National Park, shifting the park's trajectory to one of prosperity and hope.</P>
            <p>From the beginning there was a clear joint vision: to transform Akagera from a depleted landscape overrun by more than 30,000 cattle into an income-generating park for the benefit of people and wildlife. Effective conservation law enforcement measures and strong community engagement formed the foundation for rehabilitation. After practically eliminating poaching in just five years, lion and black rhino were reintroduced between 2015 and 2018, and white rhino were introduced in 2021 in a conservation move to help protect the species. With sound wildlife conservation, Akagera is now home to thriving populations of wildlife, having grown from less than 5,000 in 2010 to almost 12,000 animals today. </p>
            <p>Besides becoming a haven for wildlife, the park’s support for income-generating enterprises for local communities has grown remarkably and, together with revenue-sharing schemes, nearly US$1 million of economic activity flowed from the park into the surrounding communities in 2022. Today Akagera National Park continues its work with surrounding communities, bringing economic and social benefits, allowing the ecosystem and people to thrive together.</p>
            <h3>Nyungwe Forest National Park</h3>
            <img src="https://visitandtourrwanda.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/nyungwe-canopy-500x400.jpg">
            <p>Nyungwe Forest National Park is blessed with lots of nature and wildlife experiences for you to look out for and emerge yourself in. The forest offers a number of activities like hiking or biking the beautiful terrain, tracking the famous chimpanzees, experiencing the canopy walk, witnessing beautiful birds and relaxing by waterfalls. Sounds and sights all together make a one-of-a-kind wildlife experience. While moving or exploring through the forest, tourists will have a look at the lush green mountains and experience the cooling mist in a landscape. This scenery is unforgettable!!</p>
            <p>2004 is when Nyungwe Forest National Park was established, it seats on an area that is close to 970 km2 of the rain forest, swamps, bogs, grassland, and bamboo. Cyangugu is the nearest town to the forest with a distance of 54 km to the west of the national park. Mount Bigugu is located within the borders of the forest.</p>
            <h3>Volcanoes National Park</h3>

            <p>“In the heart of Central Africa, so high up that you shiver more than you sweat,” wrote the eminent primatologist Dian Fossey, “are great, old volcanoes towering almost 15,000 feet, and nearly covered with rich, green rainforest – the Virungas.”</p>
            <p>Situated in the far northwest of Rwanda, Volcanoes National Park protects the steep slopes of this magnificent mountain range – home of the endangered mountain gorilla and a rich mosaic of montane ecosystems, which embrace evergreen and bamboo forest, open grassland, swamp and heath.</p>
            <p>Volcanoes National Park is named after the chain of dormant volcanoes making up the Virunga Massif: Karisimbi – the highest at 4,507m, Bisoke with its verdant crater lake, Sabinyo, Gahinga and Muhabura.</p>
            
            <h3>Lake Kivu</h3>
            <img src="https://t3.gstatic.com/licensed-image?q=tbn:ANd9GcTmU0T7ZgmtndhmuOd6VFrEKGpjuMRV_9yDjd1hSmaX3D4Dj5pHpUraU4iMKOi7cvCk">
           
            <p>Lake Kivu is approximately 42 km (26 mi) long and 50 km (31 mi) at its widest.[2] Its irregular shape makes measuring its precise surface area difficult; it has been estimated to cover a total surface area of some 2,700 km2 (1,040 sq mi), making it Africa's eighth largest lake.[3] The surface of the lake sits at a height of 1,460 metres (4,790 ft) above sea level. This lake has a chance of suffering a limnic eruption every 1000 years.[2] The lake has a maximum depth of 475 m (1,558 ft) and a mean depth of 220 m (722 ft), making it the world's twentieth deepest lake by maximum depth, and the thirteenth deepest by mean depth.[2]

              Some 1,370 square kilometres (529 sq mi) or 58 percent of the lake's waters lie within DRC borders.[3]
              
              The lake bed sits upon a rift valley that is slowly being pulled apart, causing volcanic activity in the area.
              
              The world's tenth-largest island in a lake, Idjwi, lies in Lake Kivu, within the boundaries of Virunga National Park. Settlements on the lake's shore include Bukavu, Kabare, Kalehe, Sake and Goma in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Gisenyi, Kibuye, and Cyangugu in Rwanda.</p>
